## THE PROJECT END THE 18N WEDNESDAY'S NIGHT AT 08:30

## MONDAY 9N (MORNING)

In don't now waht and how i can do it. My idea its a HTML-CSS-Javascript system for the frontend and two models for the server (SQL? really I don't know)

[X] Do it the Kandband for today at the morning

[X] Do an HTML and a CSS (I need see something even only will be a simple structure)

[] Leaning more about TablePlus and accept or discard SQL for tomorrow.

OK, let's do it.

## MONDAY 9N (AFTERNOON)

Well right now, we've got a problem, for costume I consctruct a server with all the libraries for React, and also I create all of them into the server, because I'm amazing, I know. Ok, calm, right now I deleted this folders and files.

[] Edite the index.js, testing if works and adapt for the HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT schema.

[X] Construct the tables and values for peplum.sql

## TUESDAY 10N (MORNING AND AFTERNOON)

I tried yesterday, but i cannot do it all my proyections. I have to do it today, its an important part of the project, I can't desiste, if I can do it for the evening I'm in a very good way. Remember: Vainila Javascrpit and Node, that's all. First for server, late for db.

[X] Edite the index.js, testing if works.

[X] Install necessary dependencies

[X] Construct start for models, controllers, middlewares and routes.

I forgot separate the parts of morning and afternoon and right now, I don't remember. Well, the day was productive.

## WEDNESDAY 11N (MORNING)

Ok today I start later for administration issues, it's fine, for today I want to have a server with the SQL db conected.

[X] Construct a db (peplum)

[X] Create a table por peplum with TablePlus

[] Conect server and database

## WEDNESDAY 11N (AFTERNOON)

(Forgotten descpription, but was a very productive day)

[X] Insert data into peplum(db)

[X] Construct a table named 'forum' and insert data

[X] Define values for forum: a review and a relation with peplum table for id

[] Conect server and database (Im working on this, but don't understood so well...)

## THURSDAY 12N (MORNING)

Well, I fought with TablePlus for all the afternoon and, for the moment, I win. Today is the most important day? It's possible, I want let done the conexion between server and db. No more delay, later I'll be able to worry about other questions.

[X] Conect server and database

## THURSDAY 12N (AFTERNOON)

Ok, I've got the peplum server connected, but theres 2 new problems. I forget introduce the value 'image (with a url)' into peplum TABLE, and the forum TABLE doesn't come with Postman.

[X] Serching posters of release of films, introduce into a folder ./docs only for documentation and future reconstruction with Cloudinary.

[X] Connection for forum TABLE

[X] Introduce images into peplum TABLE

[] TablePlus and Postman can't read the posters of films, repair it.

[X] Introduce another film into db for look about the error is into the code or in the actualization of data
//////////DOESN'T WORK THE PROBLEM IS THE REFRESH OF DATA, NOT THE IMAGE//////////////

## FRIDAY 13N (MORNING)

Its so tired yet, so many hours... Well, doesnt work. Just before write this lines, I test if deleting Tables its posible introduce new data(the images for url), but I have an important error, url isnt a property for sql, i was believed that all the week, but reading forums I see that not. Ok, I want finish all part of server and db if its posible...

[X] Investigate how yo can introduce a url into database for load an image

[] Conect db and server to the client and see if the data looks

[] Complete the CRUD system

## FRIDAY 13N (AFTERNOON)

Ok, server and db are conected, the images are included into tables with BYTEA that serialise all data. The error with the client is something tha cant permit than CORS is readed like http when I init the client on navegator. In this moment is not so late, so I think the better way is delete the HTML-CSS-VANILAJS system and construct the client with REACT because i've got more examples and background.

[X] Delete the client

[] Do a new client with React

## SATURDAY 14N

Yesterday was not productive, the client is a true challenge for me right now, becaus I want do it with HTML-CSS-VANILA JS but I'm more experience with React (althought I dont controll so well). Dej√† le weight of this project and the time is so high, I need more easier, so for this React is better option, I have got more documentation too.

[] Retouch server for its posible the development of users

[X] Client with React

## MONDAY 16N (MORNING)

This weekend I fought vs the front-end because I dont remember just about nothing. The principal part of my time was research info and I only can run the installation of React, reset a previos commit on Github and be more confuse about how I have to do it next steps.

[X] Run the client and see the React app

[X] Do something similar to a Hello World

[X] Add a piece of Sass

[X] Conect server-client

## MONDAY 16N (AFTERNOON)

[X] Load the data into the visualitazion of front-end

[X] Construct and define pages into the client

[X] A first design for frontend

[X] CRUD into peplum and forum routes

## TUESDAY 17N (MORNING)

Its the last day, finally I can see all the data and the front-end part, im not so good with design and there are parts that arent ready like the protection of routes and the CRUD system. Later, at afternoon its time of deployment.

[] Complete CRUD system

[] Protect the posting and deleting

[] Finish with the design

[X] Include the wireframes

[] React the readme

[] At the final, do the deployment
